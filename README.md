# prototype of how to use `react-query` with `solid.js`

This is a fork of the [solid-react-query on CodeSandbox, by @wobsoriano](https://codesandbox.io/s/pqb49)

@wobsoriano did most if it! `useMutation` was not implemented yet though, so I tried implementing
that here.

The demo of `useMutation` is a bit contrived but hopefully it makes enough sense for a demo :)
